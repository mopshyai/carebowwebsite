  paragraphs: [
    "CareBow was born from a deeply personal experience. Our founder, Manvendra, like millions of Indians living abroad, faced the constant anxiety of being thousands of miles away from his aging parents.",

    "Every missed call triggered panic. Every health complaint led to sleepless nights. The guilt of not being there was overwhelming. He realized he wasn't alone — millions of families worldwide share this struggle.",

    "Traditional solutions were fragmented: unreliable caregivers, expensive services, and no way to stay truly connected to his parents' daily wellbeing. There had to be a better way.",

    "That's when CareBow was born — an all-in-one platform that combines AI-powered health guidance, dedicated care coordinators, and a network of trusted healthcare services. We don't just provide services; we become an extension of your family.",

    "Today, CareBow serves thousands of families across 8 countries, helping them stay connected, informed, and at peace. Because caring for your parents shouldn't require being physically present every moment.",
